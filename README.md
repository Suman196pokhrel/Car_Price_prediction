# End-To-End Car_Price_prediction

Here app.py contains the python code that uses sklearns ML algorithms and dataset we provide to 
generate the pickle file for the flask server.

The pickele file is them simply used by the flask server to make predictions.


## Modules Used
* Sklearn for ML algorithms like LinearRegressor() & RandomForestRegressor
* Numpy, Pandas, Matplotplib for data preprocesing and visualizations
* Flask for creating a backend for the web application
